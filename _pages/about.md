## About

I am a student developer in the US. My main skills are Python, Full stack Web Development (mainly PHP/JavaScript), Linux administration, and developing CLI applications. You can see some of my projects over at [/projects/](/projects/). I occasionally post tutorials/suggestions/ideas/random thoughts over at [/posts/](/posts/).

I am fairly busy with school, but if you need to contact me, or if you have a project idea, head over to [/contact/](/contact/). I'll try to respond as soon as possible.
